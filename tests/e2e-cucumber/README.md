# E2E Tests (cucumber-rs)

Behavioral end-to-end tests using [cucumber-rs](https://github.com/cucumber-rs/cucumber) — Gherkin `.feature` files backed by Rust step functions.

## Architecture

```
.feature files (Gherkin)  →  step functions (Rust)  →  rocm binary / mock server
```

Tests exercise the `rocm` binary as a black box — no imports from the rocm-cli codebase. Mock-tier tests use an in-process axum server; GPU-tier tests run real model serving.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (cargo)
- For GPU-tier tests: an AMD GPU with ROCm drivers and `rocm` binary on PATH

## Directory layout

## Running tests

The `cargo xtask e2e` task builds the release `rocm` binary and runs the suite.
Extra arguments after `--` are forwarded to the cucumber CLI.

```bash
# All features:
cargo xtask e2e

# Filter by scenario name:
cargo xtask e2e -- -n "model name"

# Stop on first failure:
cargo xtask e2e -- --fail-fast

# With a pre-built binary (skips the build step):
ROCM_CLI_BINARY=./target/release/rocm cargo xtask e2e
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ROCM_CLI_BINARY` | `rocm` (on PATH) | Path to the rocm binary under test |
| `ROCM_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated config directory per scenario |
| `ROCM_CLI_DATA_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated data directory per scenario |
| `ROCM_CLI_CACHE_DIR` | (temp dir) | Isolated cache directory per scenario |

## Tags and per-scenario expectations

There is no tag-filter tiering. Each CI job runs the **whole** suite
(`cargo xtask e2e`, no `-t` filter); the harness resolves every scenario to
**pass / xfail / skip** at runtime from its capability tags plus the known-bug
matrix, then reconciles the actual result against that expectation.

Scenarios carry stable-id and capability tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@id:<slug>` | Stable scenario id. Keys the expectation matrix and the report grid; every scenario has one. |
| `@requires-gpu` | Needs a real AMD GPU. Resolves to **skip** (n/a) on a host with none (e.g. the mock job). |
| `@requires-engine:<vllm\|lemonade>` | Pins the serve engine. Resolves to skip where that engine can't start (e.g. vLLM on a lemonade-only Strix host). |
| `@requires-os:<linux\|windows>` | Premise is OS-specific; skip on other OSes. |
| `@serve-timeout:<secs>` | Lengthen the serve-readiness wait for a genuinely slow serve (e.g. a large model). |
| `@nightly` | Expensive scenario skipped by default; included when `E2E_INCLUDE_NIGHTLY=1`. |

Known bugs are **not** tagged in the `.feature` files — they live in
`expectations.toml`, keyed by `@id`, each with a `when = { ... }` condition (e.g.
`effective_engine = "vllm"`), a `bug` reference, and a `reason`. A scenario that
matches a condition is expected to fail (xfail); if it then passes, that is an
**XPASS**. Deterministic XPASS is stale and must be removed; entries marked
`flaky = true` tolerate either outcome while still reporting the intermittent
bug. See `src/expectation.rs` for the resolver and `expectations.toml`'s header
for the condition grammar.

On a GPU host, a `serve` precondition that never publishes its model is
relaunched once — but only for a scenario expected to pass; a known bug keeps its
shortened `serve_timeout_secs` and fails on the first attempt. The stalled
service is stopped (whole engine process tree) before the relaunch, so the second
serve does not compete with the first for device memory, and the failure quotes
the service log tail plus the device's free-VRAM state, which is where the
engine's own reason for the stall is recorded.

CI runs one job per platform, each executing the full suite:

| Job | Platform | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| `e2e` | Mock (no GPU, GitHub-hosted) | yes |
| `e2e-gpu` | MI300X (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-ubuntu` | Strix Halo / Ubuntu (self-hosted) | no |
| `e2e-gpu-strix-windows` | Strix Halo / Windows (self-hosted) | no |

The blocking mock job passes when every applicable scenario is pass-or-xfail with
no XPASS or unexpected failure; the GPU jobs are non-blocking. The `e2e-report`
job consolidates all platforms' results into one cross-platform report.

The nightly workflow runs three non-blocking jobs — the existing MI300X job and
new Strix Halo jobs on Ubuntu and Windows — with `E2E_INCLUDE_NIGHTLY=1`. The
shared large-model scenario serves `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` through vLLM on MI300X and
the hardware-verified `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF:UD-Q4_K_XL` checkpoint
through Lemonade on Strix Halo.

Use the CI workflow dispatch to run either model independently on a ref:

```bash
# MI300X / vLLM / Qwen3.6-27B
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=app-dev-gpu \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'

# Strix Halo Linux / Lemonade / Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF (UD-Q4_K_XL)
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=strix-ubuntu \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'

# Strix Halo Windows / Lemonade / Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF (UD-Q4_K_XL)
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <ref> \
  -f platform=strix-windows \
  -f include_nightly=true \
  -f name_filter='large platform-specific model'
```

## From scenarios to tests

1. Write the `.feature` file with Gherkin scenarios (same words a user would use).
2. Add step functions in a `_steps.rs` file under `tests/e2e/`.
3. Add `pub mod <name>_steps;` to `tests/e2e.rs`.
4. Run with `cargo xtask e2e`.

The `.feature` file is both the spec and the test input — cucumber reads it at runtime and matches each step to a Rust function via `#[given]`/`#[when]`/`#[then]` annotations.

## Writing new tests

1. Write the Gherkin scenario in the appropriate `.feature` file (or create a new one for a new feature area).
2. Create a `_steps.rs` file if the feature area is new.
3. Implement step functions: Given = setup, When = action, Then = assertion.
4. Register the module in `tests/e2e.rs` with `pub mod <name>_steps;`.
5. Run to verify.

## Design principles

- **Black-box only.** Step functions interact with `rocm` through its CLI and HTTP endpoints. No imports from the rocm-cli codebase. Where a scenario needs the CLI to know about a running server, it plants a managed-service record as plain JSON matching the on-disk schema (see `register_mock_service`) — the same file `rocm serve --managed` would write — rather than importing the record type.
- **Isolated state.** Each scenario uses isolated config, data, and cache directories. Tests never touch `~/.rocm`.
- **Behavioral language.** Feature files describe what users care about, not implementation details. How steps are implemented (mock vs real, which port, which API) stays in the step functions.
- **OS-assigned ports.** The mock server binds to `127.0.0.1:0` to avoid port conflicts between tests.

## The rocm-doctor skill contract

`rocm_doctor_skill.feature` is the one feature that treats a file in this repo as
an expected value. `skills/rocm-doctor/` is a byte-verbatim mirror of a skill
published in [`amd/skills`](https://github.com/amd/skills); the skill owns no
probe, no catalog and no fixes — all of that ships inside the binary — so what it
does own is a **contract**: which fix-ids exist, which ones the CLI applies
itself, which machines each is for, what a diagnosis carries, what the exit codes
mean. Nothing else tests that seam. `diagnose.feature` deliberately asserts only
the *shape* of a diagnosis so it stays host-independent, and the `rocm-core` unit
tests cannot see a document that lives outside the crate.

So `skill_steps.rs` parses the closed-catalog table out of
`skills/rocm-doctor/reference.md` and diffs it against `rocm fix`. That is a
deliberate, narrow exception to **Black-box only** above: nothing is imported
from the rocm-cli codebase — a *documentation artifact* is read as test data, and
that artifact is the thing under test.

Two rules follow:

- The catalog is authoritative in `crates/rocm-core/src/fix.rs`. When one of
  these scenarios fails, the CLI is right and the docs are what change.
- A skill-only edit must still run this job, so `skills/**` is in the `heavy`
  paths filter that gates the `e2e` job.

None of the scenarios assert that a symptom actually matched: on a host the
catalog rules out of scope (WSL2) an empty `matched` list is the correct answer.
They assert the coupling — out of scope implies no causes offered — so the
feature is clean on WSL2, the no-GPU lane, and the GPU lanes alike.
