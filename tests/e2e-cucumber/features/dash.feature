Feature: Interactive dashboard

  # These scenarios drive the real interactive TUI through a pseudo-terminal —
  # the crossterm raw-mode event loop that a piped command can't reach. Linux
  # only for now: portable-pty compiles on Windows via ConPTY, but that path is
  # not yet promoted to a blocking contract (tracked as a follow-up).
